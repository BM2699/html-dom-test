        <h1>long live puerto rico!! 032025 </h1>
        <p>hi, this is a website recap of my trip to puerto rico in March 2025.
        <br> I went to the beach, ate some delicious food, and met some amazing people.
        <br> I can't wait to go back and explore more of the island.
        <br> I hope you enjoy the pictures and stories from my trip!</p>
