        <p1>hi, this is a website recap of my trip to puerto rico in March 2025.
        <br> I went to the beach, ate some delicious food, and met some amazing people.
        <br> I can't wait to go back and explore more of the island.
        <br> I hope you enjoy the pictures and stories from my trip!</p1>
